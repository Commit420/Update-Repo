- FBI busts $1.5M Hamas-run crypto financing scheme used to fund terrorism

The US Department of Justice (DoJ) on Thursday said it has dismantled a massive Hamas-run crypto financing scheme that was used to launder $1.5 million over the past six months.
As part of the bust, the DoJ said it had seized over $200,000 donated by Hamas supporters that was allegedly being held by the terror group across more than a dozen cryptocurrency wallets and personal accounts for future use.
The court-authorized seizure was traced from fundraising addresses purportedly controlled by Hamas, which were used to launder more than $1.5 million in virtual currency since October 2024, according to the FBI’s Counterterrorism Division and Cyber Division investigating the case.
“These seizures show that this office will search high and low for every cent of money going to fund Hamas, wherever it is found, and in whatever form of currency,” said US Attorney for the District of Columbia Edward R. Martin Jr.

- Ukraine struck by “largest cyberattack” affecting critical infrastructure

Ukraine’s state registers, which are deemed critical infrastructure in the country, were knocked out for at least two weeks after a suspected Russian cyberattack.
The attacks knocked out network infrastructure that serves Ukraine’s state registers, the nation’s Justice Ministry announced. The registers contain essential data about Ukrainian citizens, businesses, and organizations and allow access to public services online.
According to Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice, the attack was “the largest external cyber attack” on the state registers in recent times. This is saying a lot, given Russia has been persistently targeting Ukrainian systems since Moscow invaded its neighbor in February of 2022.
